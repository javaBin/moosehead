secure_your_application_with_openid_connect_workshop=<p>You should have a Java IDE (IntelliJ, Eclipse, Netbeans) and the possibility of executing curl (users of IntelliJ Ultimate can use http snippets instead).</p>
configure_jenkins_as_code=<p>Please review and setup the prerequisites as outlined on this GitHub project: <a href="https://github.com/sheeeng/jenkins-configuration-as-code-workshop-prerequisites">https://github.com/sheeeng/jenkins-configuration-as-code-workshop-prerequisites.</a> If you have any questions before the workshop, please file an issue on the project.</p>
you_too_can_be_a_sketching_machine=<p>None needed</p>
bygge_applikasjoner_med_serverless_framework_og_aws_lambda=<p>You should follow the instructions under "Setup" on <a href="https://github.com/fredriv/serverless-lambda-workshop">https://github.com/fredriv/serverless-lambda-workshop</a></p><p>If they have any questions, please ask them to contact fredrik@vraalsen.no</p>
micro_my_java_µµj=<p>As part of the preparation for the workshop, it would be very helpful if you could pull the a couple of Docker images from Docker Hub by running the following commands:</p><p>docker pull oracle/graalvm-ce:19.2.0<br/>docker pull frolvlad/alpine-glibc</p><p>The two above images are required for native compilation and running of the natively compiled Micronaut applications.</p><p>In addition to the above two images, there are a couple of optional images you can get. You may also pull the following image, if you would like to use Docker for the entire build process:</p><p>docker pull gradle:5.5-jdk8</p><p>And if you would like to run the application on a standard JVM in a Docker container, you can pull the following image:</p><p>docker pull adoptopenjdk/openjdk11-openj9:jdk-11.0.1.13-alpine-slim</p><p>The more participants are able to do this before the workshop, the less time is spent installing images from memory sticks, or a possibly highly saturated network, during the workshop.</p>
